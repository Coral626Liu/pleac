<h2>Overall</h2>
 
<p>
Following the great <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook">Perl
Cookbook</a> (by Tom Christiansen &amp; Nathan Torkington, published by
O'Reilly) which presents a suite of common programming problems solved in
the Perl language, this project aims to gather fans of programming, in
order to implement the solutions in other programming languages.
</p>

<p>
If successful, this project may become a primary resource for quick, handy
and free reference to solve most common programming problems using
higher-level programming languages, and for comparison on ease-of-use and
power/efficiency of these languages.
</p>

<p>
The material, considered as some Documentation, is wholy
released under the Gnu <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">Free
Documentation License</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please <a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pleac-discuss">subscribe</a>
to the discussion mailing-list if interested in the project.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
A copy of the build from CVS is always accessible from here. The Perl part
presents the Solutions from the Perl Cookbook.
</p>

<p>
Here is the <a href="AUTHORS">name of the authors</a> so far.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Contribute</h2>

<p>
To contribute to this projet, you may implement the Solutions shown in the
Perl Cookbook in your language of choice, writing them in a simple
description language made of <tt>@@@KEYWORD</tt> sections, as shown in
this <a href="sample.data">sample</a> or following the &quot;code&quot;
links upper.
</p>

<p>
You may add or correct code for existing languages, or extend the project
by beginning work for another language. In all cases, please <a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pleac-discuss">subscribe</a>
to the discussion mailing-list so we can discuss and include your work.
</p>

<p>
You may pay particular attention to the results produced by your code.
Given merits and drawbacks of the Perl language, main aim of the project
is to solve exactly the same problems in other languages; indeed, when a
resembling keyword of another language doesn't behave the same way, be
sure to underline this within comments in your source, and provide us with
the solution in order to solve exactly the same problem, and produce
exactly the same output.
</p>

<p>
Each time new contents is uploaded to this web site, all description
language sources are copied under the &quot;code&quot; links in the Status
section upper, and compiled into &quot;html output&quot;.
</p>

<h2>Building the project</h2>

<p>
To generate the sgml and build the html and ps outputs off the <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/pleac-cvsroot.tar.gz">sources</a>,
you'll need the relevant building software. For example, with
Linux-Mandrake 8.0, here's the list of the packages needed:
</p>

<pre class="screen">
make-3.79.1-5mdk.i586.rpm
ruby-1.6.2.2-2mdk.i586.rpm
sgml-common-0.2-4mdk 
sgml-tools-1.0.9-19mdk 
openjade-1.3-10mdk 
docbook-style-dsssl-1.64-1mdk 
docbook-dtd31-sgml-1.0-3mdk 
jadetex-3.6-1mdk 
tetex-1.0.7-21mdk 
tetex-dvips-1.0.7-21mdk 
tetex-latex-1.0.7-21mdk 
</pre>

<p>
Once the CVS snapshot is untarballed, just issue <tt>make</tt> (or just
<tt>make html</tt> for example).

<h2>Administrative</h2>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> is kind enough to <a

<p>As the legal parts of any project is primarily important, O'Reilly, who
is the publisher of the Perl Cookbook, was asked for a confirmation that
this project would not infringe patents or harm copyright and intellectual

confirm that this project would not harm in any way their business with
the Perl Cookbook. Many thanks to Linda.
