<h2>Overall</h2>
 
<p>
Being a big fan of the <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook">Perl Cookbook</a> (by Tom
Christiansen &amp; Nathan Torkington, published by O'Reilly), this project aims
to gather fans of programming, in order to implement the solutions in
other programming languages.
</p>

<p>
I hope this project can become a primary resource for quick, handy and
free reference to solve most common programming problems using
higher-level programming languages, and for comparison on ease-of-use and
power/efficiency of these languages.
</p>

<p>
To contribute to this projet, you only need to implement the Solutions
shown in the Perl Cookbook in your language of choice, writing them in a
simple description language (look at the &quot;code&quot; links in the
&quot;Status&quot; section for examples). Actually I have an sgml
skeleton, and a small Ruby program to generate a sgml source from the
skeleton and the Solutions; this sgml source then gets compiled into html
and ps output. The material, considered as some Documentation, is wholy
released under the Gnu <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">Free
Documentation License</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please <a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pleac-discuss">subscribe</a>
to the discussion mailing-list if interested in the project.
</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
A copy of the build from CVS is always accessible from here.

<h2>Building the project</h2>

<p>
To generate the sgml and build the html and ps outputs off the <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/pleac-cvsroot.tar.gz">sources</a>,
you'll need the relevant building software. For example, with
Linux-Mandrake 8.0, here's the list of the packages needed:
</p>

<pre class="screen">
make-3.79.1-5mdk.i586.rpm
ruby-1.6.2.2-2mdk.i586.rpm
sgml-common-0.2-4mdk 
sgml-tools-1.0.9-19mdk 
openjade-1.3-10mdk 
docbook-style-dsssl-1.64-1mdk 
docbook-dtd31-sgml-1.0-3mdk 
jadetex-3.6-1mdk 
tetex-1.0.7-21mdk 
tetex-dvips-1.0.7-21mdk 
tetex-latex-1.0.7-21mdk 
</pre>

<p>
Once the CVS snapshot is untarballed, just issue <tt>make</tt> (or just
<tt>make html</tt> for example).

<h2>Administrative</h2>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> is kind enough to <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pleac">host</a> this project.
</p>

<p>As the legal parts of any project is primarily important, I asked
O'Reilly, who is the publisher of the Perl Cookbook, a confirmation that I
can do what I'm trying to do. Linda Mui from O'Reilly was kind enough to
discuss with me and confirm that I'm not harming in any way their business
with the Perl Cookbook. Many thanks to Linda.
