<h2>Overall</h2>
 
<p>
Following the great <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook">Perl
Cookbook</a> (by Tom Christiansen &amp; Nathan Torkington, published by
O'Reilly) which presents a suite of common programming problems solved in
the Perl language, this project aims to gather fans of programming, in
order to implement the solutions in other programming languages.
</p>

<p>
If successful, this project may become a primary resource for quick, handy
and free reference to solve most common programming problems using
higher-level programming languages, and for comparison on ease-of-use and
power/efficiency of these languages.
</p>

<p>
The material, considered as some Documentation, is wholy released under
the Gnu <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">Free Documentation
License</a>, except the Perl part, which is copyrighted by O'Reilly &amp;
Associates yet <a href="http://examples.oreilly.com/cookbook/">freely
available</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please <a

to the discussion mailing-list if interested in the project.

The FAQ is <a href="pleac-faq.html">here</a>. You may also see <a

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
A copy of the build from CVS is always accessible from here. The Perl part
presents the Solutions from the Perl Cookbook.

<h2>Milestones</h2>

<p><b>200307.</b> The project is not evolving rapidly but still
alive: some people do contribute additions, some languages get
beginning of implementations (forth, common lisp, pike). This
main-page sees an average of 50 visitors per day.

<p><b>20011023 (beta1).</b> The project is in good shape: we now have
decent versions in Python (43%), Merd (30%), Guile (27%), Ruby (25%),
Haskell (21%), Tcl (17%), and Java (14%). It can already be used to make
basic comparisons between languages, and begins to be referred in some
programming language mailing lists. We also have starting implementations
in languages which are not part of the industry standards, but still very
important for a programmers' culture, namely OCaml (7.29%), Erlang (1.86%)
and Pliant (1.71%).
</p>

<p><b>20010803.</b> Project registered in <a
href="http://freshmeat.net/releases/54133/">Freshmeat</a>.
Versions status are: Merd 30%, Ruby 25%, Haskell and Python around 10%.
</p>

<p><b>20010523 (project founding).</b> The project has been accepted by
SourceForge. Great! Time to work on the generic sourcecode-colorized web
pages, and to begin implementations in Ruby and Merd.

<h2>Contribute</h2>

<p>
To contribute to this projet, you may implement the Solutions shown in the
Perl Cookbook in your language of choice, writing them in a simple
description language made of <tt>@@PLEAC@@_KEYWORD</tt> sections, as shown in
this <a href="sample.data">sample</a> or following the &quot;code&quot;
links upper.
</p>

<p>
You may add or correct code for existing languages, or extend the project
by beginning work for another language. In all cases, please <a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pleac-discuss">subscribe</a>
to the discussion mailing-list so we can discuss and include your work.
</p>

<p>
You may pay particular attention to the results produced by your code.
Given merits and drawbacks of the Perl language, main aim of the project
is to solve exactly the same problems in other languages; indeed, when a
resembling keyword of another language doesn't behave the same way, be
sure to underline this within comments in your source, and provide us with
the solution in order to solve exactly the same problem, and produce
exactly the same output.
</p>

<p>
Each time new contents is uploaded to this web site, all description
language sources are copied under the &quot;code&quot; links in the Status
section upper, and compiled into &quot;html output&quot;.
</p>

<p>
There is a mailing-list logging the CVS commits (see <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=772&group_id=1">SourceForge
documentation</a> on this topic), you can <a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pleac-commits">subscribe</a>
in order to be informed and discuss the commits.
</p>

<h2>Building the project</h2>

<p>
To generate the sgml and build the html outputs off the source from <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/pleac-cvsroot.tar.bz2">nightly
tarball</a> or directly via an anoymous CVS <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=27880">checkout</a>, you'll
need the relevant building software. For example, with Mandrake Linux 8.0,
here's the list of needed packages:
</p>

<pre class="screen">
make-3.79.1-5mdk.i586.rpm
ruby-1.6.2.2-2mdk.i586.rpm
sgml-common-0.2-4mdk 
sgml-tools-1.0.9-19mdk 
openjade-1.3-10mdk 
docbook-style-dsssl-1.64-1mdk 
docbook-dtd31-sgml-1.0-3mdk 
emacs-20.7-16mdk.i586.rpm
emacs-X11-20.7-17mdk.i586.rpm
</pre>

<p>
Additionally, find <tt>`htmlize.el'</tt> and put it in your
<tt>~/etc/emacs</tt>. All right, you'll probably suffer to successfully
compile the stuff ;p.

</p>

<p>As the legal parts of any project is primarily important, O'Reilly, who
is the publisher of the Perl Cookbook, was asked for a confirmation that
this project would not infringe patents or harm copyright and intellectual
property. Linda Mui from O'Reilly was kind enough to answer back and
confirm that this project would not harm in any way their business with
the Perl Cookbook. Many thanks to Linda.
