# @@PLEAC@@_NAME
# @@SKIP@@ Name-of-programming-language (ex.: Perl, Ruby, ...)
    Note: the above tag, @@SKIP@@, tells the parser where to start
          looking for the text to put as the name; in this situation
          it allows to not have the hash mark in it. If you need to
          close the comment (as for example in ocaml) you can put
          another @@SKIP@@ at the end of the line then the closing
          comment character(s).

# @@PLEAC@@_WEB

# @@PLEAC@@_INTRO
# @@SKIP@@ You need version 666 or above for this code to work.
# @@SKIP@@ I use `megadebug' to interactively debug the code.


# @@PLEAC@@_APPENDIX
    Note: this section is optional; use it if you need to import very
          generic stuff for the whole code.
import stdlib

# @@PLEAC@@_2.3
Implementation in the programming language of the
code shown in section 2.3 of the Perl CookBook.


# @@PLEAC@@_4.7
Implementation in the programming language of the
code shown in section 4.7 of the Perl CookBook.


# @@PLEAC@@_5.3
Implementation in the programming language of the
code shown in section 4.7 of the Perl CookBook.
# @@INCOMPLETE@@
    Note: the above tag, @@INCOMPLETE@@, tells the statistics
          computing that the section is incomplete. One tag counts
          for 50% incompleteness, so if you don't do the section at
          all and puts an explanation about it, you will want to put
          two tags (there is no need to do so if you have no
          explanation to put). If you simply cannot do the section,
          don't put @@INCOMPLETE@@ tags, just put the explanation
          why.

# @@PLEAC@@_7.3
# @@INCLUDE@@ include/{name}/slowcat.ext
    Note: the above tag, @@INCLUDE@@, allows to inline a short
          standalone program/script. It is useful to keep it
          separated so that users can easily run it, and we can also
          give a direct download for it on the published version.
