# @@PLEAC@@_5.3
Implementation in the programming language of the

# @@INCOMPLETE@@
    Note: the above tag, @@INCOMPLETE@@, tells the statistics
          computing that the section is incomplete. One tag counts
          for 50% incompleteness, so if you don't do the section at
          all and puts an explanation about it, you will want to put
          two tags (there is no need to do so if you have no
          explanation to put). If you simply cannot do the section,
          don't put @@INCOMPLETE@@ tags, just put the explanation
          why.

# @@PLEAC@@_7.3
# @@INCLUDE@@ include/{name}/ch07/slowcat.ext
    Note: the above tag, @@INCLUDE@@, allows to inline a short
          standalone program/script. It is useful to keep it
          separated so that users can easily run it, and we can also
          give a direct download for it on the published version.
