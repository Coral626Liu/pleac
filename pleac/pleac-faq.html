<hr />

  <h2>1. Why are you only using Cookbook stuff? I'd like to solve also
  &lt;...&gt; problem, that would be more interesting!</h2>

  <p>
  This is maybe the most frequently asked question. Probably because
  people find that their favourite programming language is not enjoying
  very much problems with need of regexp, IOs, text processing, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
  The answer is: <i>this goes beyond the scope of Pleac</i>. There is
  already much work to do if we want to write a Pleac implementation in,
  say, the 20 most used programming languages on earth. When we're
  finished with that objective, we can think of Pleac#2, with even more
  problems to solve. In the meantime, if you feel that your favourite
  language would demonstrate its strength better by solving complex
  parsing problems, compiling problems, AI problems, etc, you're free to
  begin another project by your own, or to start a Pleac#2.
  </p>

<hr />

  <h2>2. The choice of problems gives not really useful solutions. This
  project seems suited only for scripting languages!</h2>

  <p>Ok, a variation of question 1. </p>

  <p>
  Actually, the choice of problems do suggest a scripting language. But
  you encounter these kinds of problems in every language. For example,
  how do you access environment variables? how do you access program
  arguments? how do you get the list of files in a directory? This is
  still interesting and useful questions for every languages.
  </p>

<hr />

  <h2>3. Ok, but then, these questions are mostly solved by using the
  proper library.</h2>

  <p>
  Yes, one can think of Pleac as a project to show syntax differences and
  how to use the default library. For some languages, we can afford using
  an external library that brings a lot of missing features, for example
  the pcre regexp library in OCaml.
  </p>

<hr />

  <h2>4. The code is too large on my screen.</h2>

  <p>
  I have to admit it's hard to satisfy all browsers on all platforms.
  Currently, if I choose a smaller proportional font for the code, it is
  unreadable because too small using Netscape/Linux. I don't have a viable
  solution for the moment (you can mail me one if you have one).
  </p>

<hr />

  <h2>5. This would be nice if printed in a book!</h2>

  <p>
  For the moment, the project is too young for that kind of questions.
  Also, keep in mind that the code is mostly written by non-experts, so
  solutions probably have bugs and are not optimal, or not elegant, or not
  efficient, etc. I mean, we <i>try</i> to do the best we can, of course.
  </p>

  <p>
  One thing will always remain: this project will stay under the Gnu Free
  Documentation License.
  </p>

<hr />

  <h2>6. Which code style should I adopt?</h2>

  <p>
  I think it is important that we try as much as possible to keep a
  consistent style across the implementations, and across the solutions
  inside an implementation. In other words, we should try to keep an
  homogeneous level of complexity, of obfuscation, of detailing, of
  commenting, and of &quot;tutorialing&quot;.
  </p>

  <p>
  I think one will agree that we should stay close to the spirit of the
  Perl Cookbook. It's obvious that the Perl Cookbook doesn't aim at
  Experts, nor at Real-Beginners. Its target is people interested in the
  Perl language, curious to know what is the best way to solve a
  &quot;real-world&quot; problem. We should stick to this spirit: we
  should not pollute the code with too much commenting and documentation
  (this goes to a general course in the language), and we should not
  optimize in the &quot;obfuscation&quot way.
  </p>

  <p>
  Also, it is -very- important that we solve the same problems as in the
  Cookbook. For example, in the Strings section, we can see <tt>$a = $b ||
  $c</tt>. In Perl, an &quot;unbound&quot; (undeclared) variable is
  automatically initialized to something which evaluates to false in a
  boolean context. However, in Ruby, if a variable is undefined, you will
  get a NameError rather than &quot;0&quot; or &quot;false&quot;; thus,
  you can't simply use <tt>b || c</tt> in Pleac-Ruby.
  </p>

  <p>
  Generally speaking, if you have as much comment lines as code lines,
  you're far beyond the spirit.
