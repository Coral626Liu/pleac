**Foreword**

    Following the spirit of the *Perl Cookbook* [1]_ by Tom Christiansen and
    Nathan Torkington, published by O'Reilly, the *PLEAC Project* [2]_ aims to
    gather fans of programming in order to implement the solutions in other
    programming languages.

    In this document, you'll find an implementation of the solutions of the
    Perl Cookbook in the *%(language)s* language.
