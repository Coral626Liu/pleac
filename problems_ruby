Can't use Array#each since I can't change a Fixnum object "in place".

I use Array#collect!, following Pixel's idea.

Basically we have a loop in which we want to populate a Hash by pushing
back new elements to Arrays.
The problem is when we try to push back an element, because the default
element "references" the default, which is an empty array, the action is
only to make the default enlarges, not what is wanted...

See [ruby-talk#17413] for my mail exposing the problem on the Ruby ML.
(http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/17413)

Two solutions came up, [ruby-talk#17417] which enhances the Hash class to
be able to take a Proc as default value; and [ruby-talk#17419], in which I
took the solution for PLEAC (the ||= [] trick, authored by Michael
Neumann).
