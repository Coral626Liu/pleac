This is a fork of pleac project http://pleac.sourceforge.net/. on sourceforge
the project seems to be stalled., I put it here to add cookbooks for
emacs-lisp and guile languages.

Suggestions and pull request are welcome.

Some ideas for improvement.
- [ ] Modern look to the site
- [ ] Way to compare (side by side view) snippets form two(or more) languages.
- [ ] moving away from docbook (may be to rst and sphinx)
